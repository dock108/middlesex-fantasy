# Fantasy Football League Website Technology Specification Document

## Overview

The fantasy football league website will be a web-based application that allows users to create accounts, join a league, participate in a draft, manage their team throughout the regular season, and compete in the playoffs. The website will also provide live scoring updates, league standings, and a forum for users to interact with each other.

## Technology Stack

- **Front-end:** The website will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end.

- **Back-end:** The website will be built using PHP and MySQL for the back-end.

- **Web server:** The website will be hosted on a web server using Apache or Nginx.

- **Version Control:** The website code will be managed using Git version control.

## Front-end Frameworks and Libraries

- **Bootstrap:** The website will use the Bootstrap framework for responsive design and UI components.

- **jQuery:** The website will use jQuery for client-side scripting and DOM manipulation.

- **Chart.js:** The website will use Chart.js for creating charts and graphs to display league standings and statistics.

## Back-end Frameworks and Libraries

- **CodeIgniter:** The website will use the CodeIgniter PHP framework for back-end development.

- **PHPMailer:** The website will use PHPMailer to send emails to users, such as password reset emails.

- **PHPUnit:** The website will use PHPUnit for unit testing of back-end code.

## Database

- **MySQL:** The website will use MySQL as the database management system.

- **Input validation:** Input from users will be validated to prevent SQL injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.

## Performance

- **Caching:** The website will use caching techniques, such as memcached or Redis, to improve performance.

- **CDN:** The website will use a content delivery network (CDN) to improve page load times and reduce server load.

- **Optimization:** The website code will be optimized for performance, including minification of CSS and JavaScript files.
