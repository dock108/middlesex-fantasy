1. User Registration: The user will need to register to create an account and join the league. This may involve providing basic personal information such as name and email address, as well as creating a username and password.

2. League Creation: Once the user has registered, the admin (league commissioner) can create the league and set the rules, such as the number of teams, draft format, scoring rules, and roster requirements.

3. Draft: The league participants will need to participate in a draft where they select players for their team according to the league rules. This can be done either offline (in-person) or online using a draft tool.

4. Regular Season: Once the draft is complete, the regular season begins. Users will manage their teams by selecting starting lineups, making trades, and adding/dropping players throughout the season. The website will provide live scoring updates and league standings.

5. Playoffs: At the end of the regular season, the top teams will advance to the playoffs. The website will manage the playoff bracket and provide live scoring updates.

6. Offseason: During the offseason, the website will allow users to make roster moves and prepare for the next season's draft. The admin can also make changes to the league rules and settings.

7. Repeat: The cycle repeats each year, with users registering for the new season, participating in the draft, managing their teams throughout the regular season, and advancing to the playoffs.

Overall, the website's primary goal is to provide a user-friendly platform for fantasy football league participants to manage their teams, view live scoring updates, and interact with other league members. The website should be easy to navigate, and its features should be customizable to meet the specific needs of the league.
