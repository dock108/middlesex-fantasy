# Fantasy Football League Website Deployment Document

## Overview

The fantasy football league website is a web-based application that requires a web server with PHP and MySQL support to run. The deployment process involves setting up the web server, installing the necessary software and dependencies, and configuring the website files.

## Requirements

- A web server with PHP 7.0 or later and MySQL 5.6 or later installed.
- A domain name or IP address for the website.
- FTP or SSH access to the web server.

## Deployment Steps

1. Upload the website files to the web server using FTP or SSH. The files should be uploaded to the web root directory or a subdirectory, depending on the desired URL structure.

2. Create a MySQL database and user for the website. Grant the user full privileges on the database.

3. Configure the database connection settings in the website configuration file. The configuration file is typically located in the `application/config` directory and is named `database.php`. Update the database name, username, password, and host settings to match the MySQL database and user created in step 2.

4. Set the appropriate file and directory permissions for the website files. The `application/cache` and `application/logs` directories should be writable by the web server. The `index.php` file and the `assets` directory should also be readable by the web server.

5. Test the website by visiting the domain name or IP address in a web browser. The website should display the home page and allow users to create accounts and join leagues.

6. Optionally, set up SSL/TLS encryption for the website using a certificate from a trusted certificate authority. This will provide secure HTTPS connections for users and protect user data.

7. Set up regular backups of the website files and database to prevent data loss in case of server failure or other issues. Backups should be stored on a separate server or cloud storage service for added redundancy.

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance of the website includes applying security updates and patches to the server software and the website code, monitoring server performance and resource usage, and responding to user feedback and support requests.

## Conclusion

Following these deployment steps and maintenance procedures will ensure that the fantasy football league website is available and functioning properly for users to enjoy the experience of playing fantasy football.
