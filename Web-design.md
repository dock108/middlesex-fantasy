# Fantasy Football League Website Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design of a fantasy football league website. The website will allow users to create accounts, join a league, participate in a draft, manage their team throughout the regular season, and compete in the playoffs. The website will also provide live scoring updates, league standings, and a forum for users to interact with each other.

## Features

### User Registration

Users will be able to create an account on the website by providing basic personal information, such as their name and email address. They will also create a username and password.

### League Creation

Once a user has created an account, they will be able to create a league or join an existing one. The league creator (admin) will be able to set the rules, such as the number of teams, draft format, scoring rules, and roster requirements.

### Draft

The website will provide a draft tool that users can use to select players for their team according to the league rules. The draft can be done either offline (in-person) or online.

### Regular Season

Once the draft is complete, the regular season begins. Users will manage their team by selecting starting lineups, making trades, and adding/dropping players throughout the season. The website will provide live scoring updates and league standings.

### Playoffs

At the end of the regular season, the top teams will advance to the playoffs. The website will manage the playoff bracket and provide live scoring updates.

### Offseason

During the offseason, the website will allow users to make roster moves and prepare for the next season's draft. The admin can also make changes to the league rules and settings.

### Forum

The website will include a forum where users can interact with each other, discuss league-related topics, and share fantasy football strategies.

## Technology

The website will be built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and PHP and MySQL for the back-end. The website will be hosted on a web server using Apache or Nginx.

## User Interface

The user interface will be designed to be simple, intuitive, and easy to use. The website will use a responsive design that can be accessed on different devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Security

The website will use secure user authentication to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. The website will also use HTTPS to encrypt all data transmissions between the client and server.

## Monetization

The website will be monetized through advertising and premium features, such as access to expert analysis or premium league settings. The website may also charge a fee for users to join a league.

## Conclusion

This design document outlines the key features, technology, user interface, security, and monetization of a fantasy football league website. By following this document, we can build a website that meets the needs of fantasy football league participants and provides a user-friendly platform for managing their teams and interacting with other users.
